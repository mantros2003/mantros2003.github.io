# Making a terminal-based spreadsheet application
In this short blog, I will be documenting my process of building a command-line spreadsheet application. This blog will cover general things that I learn about spreadsheets while building the project and things like why I take certain decisions, the datastructures I use, better ways of implementing a functionality.

## Why spreadsheet
Because I have to build a spreadsheet in one of my courses. However, I wish to continue building this project as a way to learn more about a technology that is being used by milions of people.

## Why blog
I am writing a blog to better organize what I learn during this project. Also, I hope this helps me in improving my writing skills.
